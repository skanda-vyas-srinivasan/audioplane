# AudioPlane Python SDK

The source-aware, bidirectional async SDK for the local AudioPlane Runtime. It connects
only to the local Unix-domain Runtime and keeps Core Audio details out of
application code. The core package has no runtime dependencies and supports
Python 3.9+.

## Install the command-line client with pipx

AudioPlane has not been published to PyPI. Install the current public repository
directly with `pipx`:

```sh
pipx install \
  "git+https://github.com/skanda-vyas-srinivasan/audioplane.git#subdirectory=SDKs/python"

audioplane version
audioplane doctor
audioplane sources
```

This installs the `audioplane` client and `audioplane-mcp` control server in an
isolated Python environment. It does **not** install or sign the native macOS
Runtime; Process Tap permission belongs to that native executable. Build and
start the signed Runtime using the repository quickstart before running commands
that connect to it.

With the first-party `AudioPlane Input` device installed, the CLI can keep one
virtual-microphone session open and speak each line entered at the prompt:

```sh
audioplane speak
```

Type `/quit` to stop. The command uses the local macOS `say` voice by default;
`audioplane speak --voice Samantha --rate 190` selects a voice and speech rate.

When an application uses AudioPlane Input instead of a physical microphone,
keep the current macOS microphone in the mix with:

```sh
audioplane mic-through
```

This resolves the annotated default microphone and forwards 48 kHz mono PCM
through the Runtime until `Ctrl-C`. `audioplane speak` and model response audio
can run concurrently. Use `--source ID_OR_NAME` for a different physical input;
the SDK rejects a source/destination pair that is the same Core Audio device.

For local development against a checkout:

```sh
pipx install --editable SDKs/python
```

New Python code can use the AudioPlane name:

```python
from audioplane import AudioPlane

async with AudioPlane() as audio:
    for source in await audio.sources():
        print(source.name)
```

The existing `sonexis` import remains available for compatibility with v1.0
applications and examples.

## Install for repository development

```sh
cd /path/to/audioplane
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ./SDKs/python
python -c 'import audioplane; print(audioplane.__version__)'
```

The editable install is the normal repository-development path. Release
engineering also builds a wheel and source distribution locally; install the
wheel into a clean environment with `python -m pip install PATH_TO_WHEEL`.
AudioPlane packages are not currently published to PyPI.

For completely offline testing, installation is unnecessary:

```sh
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/SDKs/python/src" /usr/bin/python3 -m unittest discover \
  -s SDKs/python/tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

## Capture one application

Start with [getting started](../../docs/getting-started.md) for permissions and
separate Runtime installation. Choose [realtime or capture-then-analysis](../../docs/developer-workflows.md)
based on your application; neither requires implementing Core Audio.

```python
import asyncio
from audioplane import AudioPlane

async def main():
    async with AudioPlane() as sx:
        async with await sx.capture("Discord") as stream:
            async for frame in stream:
                print(frame.source.name, frame.timestamp_ns, len(frame.data))

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Async ownership

Use context managers as the canonical ownership boundary:

- `async with AudioPlane() as sx` owns the control connection and closes every
  capture, output, and event subscription it created.
- Capture and playback perform an asynchronous Runtime request first, so write
  `async with await sx.capture(...)` and
  `async with await sx.playback(...)`.
- `sx.session()` and `sx.duplex(...)` return convenience context managers
  directly, so do not add `await` after `async with` for those calls.
- Breaking an `async for` loop does not replace explicit ownership. Keep the
  stream inside its context, especially when cancellation or exceptions can
  leave the loop early.
- `reconnect()` creates only a new control connection. It never revives or
  silently replaces resources owned by an earlier Runtime instance.

Cancellation of a mutating request closes its owning control connection when
the result is ambiguous, allowing Runtime cleanup to remain authoritative.
Read-only request cancellation leaves an otherwise healthy connection usable.
Control requests have a 10-second deadline covering socket backpressure and the
response wait. Set `AudioPlane(request_timeout=30.0)` to change it. A timeout
raises `SonexisConnectionError` with code `request_timeout`; timed-out mutating
requests reconcile ownership by closing the control connection.
Positive source/destination wait timeouts also cover an in-flight discovery
lookup. For compatibility, a zero timeout performs one snapshot lookup under
the normal control-request deadline and raises a wait-timeout error if no match exists.

`capture` accepts a Runtime source ID, bundle identifier, PID passed as a Python
`int`, exact application name, or `AudioSource`. A numeric string remains a
string selector. A name must resolve uniquely; the SDK raises
`AmbiguousSourceError` rather than guessing. Use `find_sources`, `get_source`,
or `wait_for_source` for discovery and applications that launch later.
Physical inputs use stable `microphone:<Core Audio UID>` IDs, kind
`"microphone"`, and optional `is_default` metadata. `default_microphone()`
resolves the current default without guessing when metadata is ambiguous.

Every delivered `AudioFrame` includes its immutable source snapshot, session and
stream IDs, sequence, format, session-relative timestamp, discontinuity/drop
state, and SDK receipt time. `estimated_capture_at_ns` is an approximate Runtime
presentation coordinate—not a preserved Core Audio host timestamp.

## Play realtime audio

The Runtime, rather than the Python process, owns the selected output device:

```python
import asyncio
from audioplane import AudioFormat, AudioPlane

async def play(model_audio):
    async with AudioPlane() as sx:
        async with await sx.playback(
            destination="default",
            format=AudioFormat.openai_realtime_output(),
            target_buffer_milliseconds=60,
        ) as output:
            async for pcm_chunk in model_audio:
                await output.write(pcm_chunk)

# Call `await play(model_audio)` from your application's async entry point.
```

`write()` accepts `bytes`, `bytearray`, or `memoryview` containing whole,
interleaved PCM sample frames. Each nonempty write must contain at least 1 ms
of audio; coalesce smaller model fragments first. It serializes concurrent callers and splits
large chunks into protocol packets no longer than 200 ms. Awaiting `write()`
applies Unix-socket backpressure; the SDK does not add an unbounded queue.
Supply `timestamp_ns=` when a producer has a stream-relative presentation
timestamp. Otherwise the SDK derives continuous timestamps from frames sent.

Normal context-manager exit rejects new and waiting writes, finishes the active
write, then sends EOS and waits for the Runtime to drain. The three-second drain
deadline includes the active write; expiry discards remaining output.
`await output.cancel()` can override graceful close immediately: it closes the stream
without EOS and asks the Runtime to discard buffered playback. `flush()`
discards queued audio while keeping the logical session, attaches the new
stream epoch returned by the Runtime, and resets sequence/timestamp state.

Use `await sx.output_destinations()` to enumerate typed
`AudioOutputDestination` values. `await output.refresh()` or
`await sx.output_status(output.info.id)` returns `OutputInfo` and
`OutputMetrics`, including input/rendered/dropped frames, underruns, overruns,
queue depth, buffered duration, conversion work, route changes, and whether a
producer is attached. The `default` destination follows the current macOS
default output device. A Runtime without the v0.4 `output_sessions` capability
fails these calls with `unsupported_capability` instead of sending unsupported
commands.

Use `find_output_destinations()`, `get_output_destination()`, and
`wait_for_output_destination()` to search snapshots, resolve an exact ID or
name, or wait for a device to appear. `"loopback"` and `"virtual_input"` are
accepted only when they identify one unambiguous installed loopback. The SDK
raises typed not-found/ambiguity errors rather than choosing silently.

Installed loopback HAL devices are returned as `virtual_input` destinations
when recognizable and can be selected by their `coreaudio:<UID>` ID or exact
name. AudioPlane includes a source-built first-party driver, but installation
remains explicit; destination enumeration is the authoritative source of
availability. `await output.refresh()` updates the
creation-time destination snapshot after a default-device change.

Capture and output can also be owned together without imposing agent policy:

```python
async with AudioPlane() as sx:
    async with sx.duplex(
        "Discord",
        input_format=AudioFormat.gemini_live(),
        output_format=AudioFormat.gemini_live_output(),
    ) as session:
        async for frame in session.input:
            ...
            await session.output.write(response_pcm)
```

The application still decides turn-taking and feedback behavior. Call
`await session.output.flush()` to discard a partial response while keeping the
duplex session, or `cancel()` to tear output down immediately.

For a public-API-only loop with a fake passthrough model, negotiate the same
format on both sides. Real model output must instead match `output_format`:

```python
import asyncio
from audioplane import AudioFormat, AudioPlane

async def main():
    format = AudioFormat.speech_16k()
    async with AudioPlane() as sx:
        async with sx.duplex(
            "Discord", input_format=format, output_format=format
        ) as session:
            async for frame in session.input:
                # Replace this passthrough with a model producing `format`.
                await session.output.write(frame.data)

asyncio.run(main())
```

Use headphones for passthrough/duplex experiments; AudioPlane does not implement
acoustic echo cancellation.

The output data plane uses the same 64-byte SXPC v2 PCM envelope as capture,
but in the client-to-Runtime direction. Continuous audio never travels in JSON
control requests.

## Multiple labeled sources

```python
async with AudioPlane() as sx:
    async with sx.session() as group:
        await group.add("conversation", "Discord")
        await group.add("media", "Spotify")

        async for item in group.frames():
            print(item.label, item.source.name, item.timestamp_ns)
```

Captures remain independent and are never mixed. Every label has a fair queue
bounded to `max_queue_packets` complete `AudioFrame` packets. `group.dropped_frames` and
`dropped_frames_by_label` count lost PCM sample frames; the next retained frame
reports a local discontinuity. Independent Process Taps do not promise sample-accurate
cross-application synchronization.

`fail_fast=True` is the default: one member failure raises from `frames()` and
the context manager closes the group. Use `fail_fast=False` for independent
long-running members and inspect `errors_by_label` when one source ends.

## Format presets

```python
from audioplane import AudioFormat

AudioFormat.speech_16k()
AudioFormat.openai_realtime()  # PCM16 mono, 24 kHz
AudioFormat.gemini_live()      # PCM16 mono, 16 kHz
AudioFormat.openai_realtime_output()  # PCM16 mono, 24 kHz
AudioFormat.gemini_live_output()      # PCM16 mono, 24 kHz
```

These are convenience values. The Runtime handshake remains authoritative for
supported formats.

## Optional realtime providers

Provider adapters are isolated above the SDK and require opt-in dependencies:

The dependency-free core supports Python 3.9. Provider and MCP extras require
Python 3.10 or newer because their official upstream SDKs do. Create a separate
environment with any installed 3.10+ interpreter before installing an extra:

```sh
python3.10 -m venv .venv-ai
. .venv-ai/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[openai]'
```

```sh
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[openai]'
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[gemini]'
```

```python
from audioplane import AudioFormat, AudioPlane
from audioplane.providers import GeminiLiveSink, GeminiTurnDetectionConfig

async with AudioPlane() as sx:
    turns = GeminiTurnDetectionConfig(silence_duration_ms=1200)
    async with await GeminiLiveSink.connect(model="gemini-3.8-live", turn_detection=turns) as model:
        async with await sx.capture(
            "Google Chrome", format=AudioFormat.gemini_live()
        ) as stream:
            async for frame in stream:
                await model.send_audio(frame)
```

This fragment shows the send path only. Consume `model.events()` concurrently
to receive text/audio and surface provider failures; the [runnable streaming
example](../../docs/developer-workflows.md#realtime-process-while-the-source-plays)
and packaged `audioplane agent` do that. A provider stall can backpressure direct
forwarding; use the packaged bounded pipeline for conversational behavior.

For a complete recording review, run
`python Examples/capture-and-review.py --source "Google Chrome" --duration 205`
from a checkout with the Gemini extra installed and the key exported. It uses
captured audio directly, not a website transcript, and retains PCM in memory.

OpenAI reads `OPENAI_API_KEY`; Gemini reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` and optionally
`GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL`. Each sink accepts one ordered AudioPlane stream; create one
sink per source label. No adapter logs or persists audio or credentials. Network
behavior must be validated with the developer's own provider account.

Gemini uses hybrid VAD by default: server automatic VAD remains enabled while
the adapter buffers a short activity onset and sends one `audio_stream_end`
after a debounced local pause. Silence after finalization is not transmitted,
and new meaningful activity reopens the stream. Configure start/end RMS,
minimum activity, and silence duration with `GeminiTurnDetectionConfig`, or
inject the SDK's `VoiceActivityDetector` extension for speech-aware detection.
`WebRTCVoiceActivityDetector` is a provided optional classifier, installed with
the Gemini extra. The packaged Gemini agent uses it by default to avoid waiting
for literal silence in a noisy room. It confirms 100 ms of speech, tolerates
100 ms onset gaps, and ends after 1,200 ms of non-speech. Configure it with
`--gemini-vad-mode`, `--gemini-min-activity-ms`, `--gemini-onset-gap-ms`, and
`--gemini-silence-ms`. Choose `--gemini-vad energy` for the legacy RMS detector;
RMS start/end options affect only that mode. For direct sink usage:

```python
from audioplane import WebRTCVoiceActivityDetector
from audioplane.providers import GeminiLiveSink

model = await GeminiLiveSink.connect(
    voice_activity_detector=WebRTCVoiceActivityDetector(mode=2),
)
```

`--debug` prints input levels and detector state once per second. The classifier
retains less than one 10 ms block and runs outside the Runtime/audio callback.

For the complete packaged capture/provider/playback lifecycle, use the same
entry point installed by the wheel:

```sh
audioplane agent \
  --provider gemini \
  --gemini-model gemini-3.8-live \
  --source "Google Chrome" \
  --response-output coreaudio:com.audioplane.input.device \
  --gemini-barge-in \
  --validate-live \
  --debug
```

The base `audioplane` commands remain usable without provider extras. The
agent imports provider integrations lazily and reports missing optional
dependencies or credentials as structured, actionable failures.

## Replay, activity, and diagnostics

`ReplayStream.from_wav(...)` and `ReplayStream.from_pcm(...)` yield normal
source-aware frames, with optional realtime pacing, for deterministic adapter
tests. `measure_activity(frame)` reports RMS/peak and non-silence activity; it
does not claim to detect speech. Applications may implement the
`VoiceActivityDetector` protocol with their chosen VAD.

`AudioActivityDetector(ActivityDetectionConfig(...))` provides debounced
`activity_started` / `activity_ended` edges with source/session/stream context.
It runs on the consuming task, resets on discontinuities, and accepts an
optional `VoiceActivityDetector` for speech-aware classification. Use one
detector per AudioPlane stream; `reset()` clears debounce state but deliberately
retains stream affinity.

`LatencyTracker` keeps a bounded sample window and reports p50/p95/p99 estimates
from Runtime session presentation time to SDK receipt. These estimates exclude
provider response/network latency and are not live Process Tap capture latency.

## MCP control plane

The optional MCP server requires Python 3.10+ and the `mcp` extra:

```sh
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[mcp]'
python -m sonexis.mcp_server
```

Runtime/source/diagnostic/output-destination tools are local and low-bandwidth.
Capture tools are not registered unless the server is launched with
`--allow-capture`. MCP
never carries PCM. Attach an audio process through the binary data plane:

```python
async with AudioPlane() as sx:
    async with await sx.attach_capture(session_id) as stream:
        async for frame in stream:
            ...
```

The MCP process owns sessions it creates, cannot inspect another client's
capture, and must remain running. Session results omit binary socket paths;
closing its
Runtime control connection stops those captures.

## Failure and reconnect behavior

Errors preserve a stable `code`, `message`, `retryable`, and `details` mapping.
Specialized exceptions cover missing/ambiguous/unavailable sources, permission,
formats, session limits, slow consumers, protocol failures, connection failures,
capture failures, and provider failures. `reconnect()` creates a fresh control
connection but never silently recreates captures or binds to a relaunched app.

`PermissionDeniedError` maps an explicit `permission_denied` Runtime response.
Core Audio does not consistently distinguish a denied Process Tap from other
initialization failures, so missing permission may instead raise
`CaptureFailedError` with code `capture_initialization_failed` and actionable
permission guidance. In either case, enable `sonexis-runtime` in **System
Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen & System Audio Recording**, restart the
Runtime, and retry live capture; source enumeration alone does not verify it.
