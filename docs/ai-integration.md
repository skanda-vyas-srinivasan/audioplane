# Building AI audio applications with AudioPlane

## Boundary

AudioPlane supplies local, source-aware audio infrastructure. It discovers macOS
applications, captures them with Process Taps, normalizes PCM, preserves source
identity, delivers bounded realtime streams, and accepts generated PCM for
bounded HAL playback or an installed loopback input. It does not transcribe
audio, run a model, remember conversations, synthesize speech, or send data to
a cloud service unless application code explicitly adds a provider adapter.

```text
application -> AudioPlane input -> SDK -> provider -> SDK -> AudioPlane output -> device
```

Provider code never enters the capture/output core or Runtime protocol.

## Quickstart

For a fresh checkout, start with [getting started](getting-started.md). It
covers signing, separate Runtime/SDK installation, a hidden credential prompt,
capture verification and output. The commands below run from the checkout root
in an activated Python 3.10+ environment for provider use.

Build and start the signed Runtime as documented in
[`sonexis-runtime.md`](sonexis-runtime.md), then install the Python SDK:

```sh
cd /path/to/audioplane
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ./SDKs/python
```

```python
import asyncio
from audioplane import AudioPlane

async def main():
    async with AudioPlane() as sx:
        async with await sx.capture("Spotify") as stream:
            async for frame in stream:
                print(frame.source.name, frame.sequence, len(frame.data))

asyncio.run(main())
```

Selectors may be an `AudioSource`, Runtime source ID, bundle identifier, PID
passed as an integer, or exact application name. Numeric strings remain string
selectors. AudioPlane never fuzzy-picks an ambiguous name.

## Choose when to analyze audio

AudioPlane always supplies live PCM frames. **Realtime** consumers forward
frames as they arrive; **capture-then-analysis** consumers retain a bounded
clip and request a review afterward. This is application policy, not a Runtime
mode or different engine. [Developer workflows](developer-workflows.md) explains
both patterns, concurrent response consumption, source scope and privacy.

To review a complete presentation rather than answer at each pause:

```sh
python -m pip install --upgrade './SDKs/python[gemini]'
python Examples/capture-and-review.py --source "Google Chrome" --duration 205
```

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` first. The example receives AudioPlane PCM, builds a WAV
in memory, and uses Google's Interactions API for a text review. It saves no
audio and uses `store=False`. It neither downloads the video nor reads website
transcripts. `--capture-only` verifies audio without cloud access. Chrome is
an application-wide source: pause other audible tabs.

## Source-aware frames

Each Python frame exposes source, session, and stream IDs; application name and
bundle identifier; sequence; session-relative timestamp; format; SDK receipt
time; discontinuity; and known drops. Source metadata is resolved once at
capture start and attached in the SDK, so variable strings are not duplicated
in the 64-byte realtime header.

`estimated_capture_at_ns` combines Runtime session-start and media position for
coarse monotonic ordering. It is not a HAL host timestamp. Independent taps are
not guaranteed to be sample-accurately synchronized.

## Multiple labeled sources

```python
async with AudioPlane() as sx:
    async with sx.session(max_queue_packets=128) as group:
        await group.add("conversation", "Discord")
        await group.add("media", "Spotify")
        async for item in group.frames():
            print(item.label, item.source.name, item.timestamp_ns)
```

The streams retain independent sessions, sequences, timestamps, buffers,
metrics, and lifecycle. Each label has a bounded, fairly drained packet queue.
A full label queue drops new frames and increments aggregate and per-label
PCM-sample-frame counters; the next retained labeled frame reports local
discontinuity. Runtime-side drops remain visible on each frame/session. No
anonymous mix is produced.

Run `Examples/multi-source-runtime.py Discord Spotify` for a live demonstration.

## OpenAI GPT-Live

Install the optional official SDK and keep the API key in the environment:

```sh
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[openai]'
export OPENAI_API_KEY='...'
audioplane agent --provider openai --source Discord
```

`AudioFormat.openai_realtime()` requests mono PCM16LE at 24 kHz. The adapter
base64-encodes complete PCM samples and uses the official SDK's GPT-Live
`session.input_audio.append` interface. The current implementation follows the
official server WebSocket guide:
<https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/guides/voice-websockets>.
Returned audio events declare `AudioFormat.openai_realtime_output()` and can be
routed through the common Runtime output plane with `--response-output default`.

## Gemini Live

```sh
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[gemini]'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='...'
export GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL='gemini-3.8-live'  # explicit current model
audioplane agent \
  --provider gemini --source 'Google Chrome' \
  --response-output default --debug
```

`AudioFormat.gemini_live()` requests raw mono PCM16LE at 16 kHz. The adapter
uses `send_realtime_input` with `audio/pcm;rate=16000`, matching Google's Live
API capability guide: <https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/capabilities>.

The Gemini adapter keeps server automatic VAD enabled and adds edge-triggered
local turn finalization for application audio. A short confirmed activity onset
opens a segment; a configurable meaningful pause sends exactly one
`audio_stream_end`; post-finalization silence is suppressed until activity
resumes. Runtime-sized input packets are coalesced into approximately 100 ms
provider chunks before transmission, and the final partial chunk is flushed
before the turn-ending signal. This follows Gemini Live's realtime PCM chunking
guidance without changing Runtime capture framing. `GeminiTurnDetectionConfig` controls start/end RMS thresholds, minimum
activity, tolerated onset gaps, and silence duration, and applications can inject a
`VoiceActivityDetector` when energy detection is insufficient. The packaged
`audioplane agent --provider gemini` now uses `WebRTCVoiceActivityDetector` by
default, installed by the `gemini` extra. It classifies speech rather than
requiring background sound to fall below a fixed loudness threshold. The
reference CLI uses 100 ms of confirmed speech, tolerates 100 ms onset gaps,
and finalizes after 1,200 ms of non-speech. The gap window is bounded so sparse
clicks cannot accumulate indefinitely. The sink's direct API retains its energy
detector unless a classifier is supplied; its default confirmed activity is
250 ms with 100 ms tolerated onset gaps.

Use `--gemini-vad-mode 0` through `3` to configure WebRTC aggressiveness (default
`2`), `--gemini-min-activity-ms`, `--gemini-onset-gap-ms`, and
`--gemini-silence-ms` to configure debounce. `--gemini-vad energy` explicitly
selects the legacy loudness detector; `--gemini-start-threshold` and
`--gemini-end-threshold` apply only in that mode. Server automatic VAD remains
enabled in both modes. WebRTC accepts complete 10 ms mono PCM16 blocks; the SDK
reblocks variable Runtime packets without resampling, retains at most one
partial block, and resets classifier history on discontinuities. Everything
runs on the consumer task, outside the Runtime/audio callback.

With `--debug`, once per second the adapter prints input RMS/peak, local state,
and accumulated non-speech duration. This distinguishes a silent microphone,
an onset that never confirms, and an input that never reaches a local pause.
These diagnostics contain no PCM or credentials.

Output audio
transcription is enabled so the reference application prints readable model
responses even when the response modality is audio. Input transcription is
also enabled and appears only in `--debug` output, making it possible to verify
that Gemini received intelligible source audio without logging it by default.

Application audio often resumes while Gemini is still generating. The adapter
therefore requests Gemini's `NO_INTERRUPTION` activity policy by default so a
new Chrome/Discord activity burst cannot silently cancel the preceding answer.
Interactive applications that intentionally want provider-level barge-in can
set `allow_response_interruptions=True`; the reference application exposes
this as `--gemini-barge-in`. Debug output reports turn-end-to-response-start
latency and explicit server interruption events.

The CLI retains `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` as its compatibility default,
while the direct sink has a different default. Set `--gemini-model MODEL` or
`GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL` explicitly; this guide uses `gemini-3.8-live`, matching the
[current Google SDK guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/live-api/get-started-sdk).
Model availability is account-dependent. A model with proactive audio may intentionally decline to
respond to passive commentary even when the adapter finalized the turn
correctly.

Live capture and provider sending are decoupled by a bounded 32-packet,
drop-oldest queue. A slow provider therefore causes explicit
`provider_dropped` frames and a discontinuity instead of silently turning live
audio into seconds-old audio. By default the reference application also drops
new source audio while a non-interruptible Gemini response is active, avoiding
an unbounded sequence of stale turns. `--gemini-barge-in` opts into overlapping
input and Gemini's interruption behavior when that conversational policy is
preferred. On a server interruption event, the reference application discards
queued response PCM and flushes Runtime's output stream before playing the next
response.

The authenticated live path was validated on 2026-09-26 with Google Chrome:
local activity start/end were detected, exactly one `audio_stream_end` was
sent, Gemini understood and referenced the captured commentary, readable output
transcription arrived, the Gemini turn completed, and AudioPlane reported zero
dropped frames.

Gemini returned-audio events declare 24 kHz mono PCM16. The reference app sends
that PCM through `sx.playback()`; no Python playback package or provider-specific
Runtime path is involved.

Both adapters require Python 3.10+, accept one ordered source stream per sink,
and accept injected sessions/transports for credential-free tests.
OpenAI network behavior and provider failure cases still require manual
validation with the developer's account. Gemini's normal authenticated path is
validated; quota failure and network-interruption behavior remain manual.

## Reference audio agent

`audioplane agent` is the packaged reference application and imports only
public SDK APIs. `Examples/audio-agent/audio_agent.py` is a thin compatibility
wrapper around the same implementation. It selects and switches sources, sends frames to OpenAI,
Gemini, or an offline mock, prints provider events and stream/drop/latency
statistics, watches source/runtime lifecycle events, optionally writes PCM/WAV,
and shuts down cleanly. `--response-output default` plays Gemini or OpenAI
speech through AudioPlane; an installed loopback destination ID sends the same
audio to an application's selected microphone. Its README contains exact
commands. Provider receive and Runtime playback run in separate tasks with a
bounded queue, so a stalled output destination cannot freeze later provider
events or grow memory without limit; exhaustion is reported explicitly.
Returned PCM is emitted in paced 50 ms packets with no more than 150 ms of
intentional lead. A provider's final sub-millisecond PCM fragment is padded
with silence to Runtime's one-millisecond minimum. These rules handle bursty
provider delivery without the render-queue drops or fatal short-packet errors
that direct event-by-event writes can cause.

Use `--validate-live` to correlate local activity, input finalization,
provider-response start/completion/interruption, and Runtime output start. It
prints one concise PASS/WARN result per completed turn. `--validation-json`
writes the final timing/drop summary to a private regular file. Neither form
retains PCM, credentials, or transcript text; `--debug` transcription remains
separate and should not be copied into privacy-sensitive logs.

The packaged pipeline also keeps capture-to-provider and provider-to-output
workers separately bounded. The deterministic release gate subjects these
workers to at least one million seeded state transitions, randomized provider
chunk sizes, provider stalls, repeated barge-in, output disappearance, and
task-leak checks. This complements rather than replaces authenticated live
provider and audible-device validation.

## Duplex and barge-in

`sx.duplex(...)` owns one independent capture and output session. It is a small
lifecycle helper, not an agent framework:

```python
async with sx.duplex(
    "Discord",
    input_format=AudioFormat.gemini_live(),
    output_format=AudioFormat.gemini_live_output(),
) as session:
    async for frame in session.input:
        await model.send_audio(frame)
        # A separate response task writes provider PCM:
        await session.output.write(response_pcm)
```

Applications choose when to interrupt. `await session.output.flush()` drops
buffered speech and starts a fresh stream epoch while keeping capture active;
`cancel()` tears output down immediately. Process-specific capture does not
digitally recapture Runtime playback, but AudioPlane does not provide acoustic
echo cancellation. Prefer headphones and treat loopback/remote echo policy as
an application concern.

## Replay and activity

`ReplayStream.from_wav` and `.from_pcm` generate deterministic source-aware
frames with sequence and timestamps. Realtime pacing is optional. Replay tests
SDK consumers and adapters without requesting macOS capture permission; the
existing Runtime integration harness separately tests real protocol-v2 binary
framing with synthetic PCM.

`measure_activity(frame)` computes normalized RMS/peak outside the realtime
callback. Its `active` flag means non-silent signal, not speech. Applications
may supply a real VAD through the `VoiceActivityDetector` protocol; AudioPlane does
not ship an unvalidated speech detector.

`AudioActivityDetector` adds provider-neutral start/end edges with separate
thresholds and sustained-on/sustained-silence debounce. It runs on the SDK
consumer task, resets on discontinuities, and can use an application-supplied
`VoiceActivityDetector`. Gemini uses this same primitive for hybrid turn
finalization. TypeScript exposes the equivalent detector and accepts an
application-supplied `VoiceActivityDetector` classifier.
Detectors are stream-affine; create one detector for each labeled capture.

Provider events carry normalized `response_started` and `response_completed`
flags plus source, capture-session, and stream correlation learned from input.
Original provider event types remain available; `raw` is unstable
provider-private diagnostic data.

[External agent-framework integration](agent-framework-integration.md).

## MCP control plane

Install `SDKs/python[mcp]` under Python 3.10+ and run:

```sh
python -m sonexis.mcp_server
```

The default tools report Runtime metadata, list/resolve sources, query
diagnostics, and discover output destinations. `--allow-capture` registers
start/list/get/stop capture tools, restricts them to sessions owned by that MCP
process, and makes sensitive mutation explicit. Results omit private socket
paths. A start result tells a consumer to call
`await sx.attach_capture(session_id)` with the SDK. Audio never passes through
MCP. The MCP control connection continues to own that session and must remain
alive until capture stops. The server is stdio-only and returns bounded JSON
error text (the current MCP Python SDK does not expose typed error
`structuredContent`). Realtime PCM never passes through MCP.

## Latency and failure semantics

`LatencyTracker` computes bounded p50/p95/p99 estimates from the Runtime
presentation coordinate to SDK receipt. Provider send receipts add the local
send time. They exclude network/model response latency, and the presentation
estimate is not true Process Tap latency.

Structured SDK errors distinguish source not found/ambiguous/unavailable,
permission denial, unsupported format, session limits, slow consumers,
terminal capture/output failure, unavailable/disconnected destinations, Runtime
connection/protocol failure, and provider failure. `retryable` is advisory.
Reconnection never silently restarts captures, rebinds a relaunched
application, or resumes partially played output.

## Privacy and security

- Runtime and MCP are local-only; Runtime authenticates the peer UID.
- The macOS user account is the trust boundary. Same-UID unsandboxed processes
  can use Runtime's granted capture permission and inject output audio.
- MCP mutation is disabled by default.
- Provider keys stay in environment/process configuration and are never logged.
- Audio is not persisted unless the application explicitly chooses an output.
- Example/CLI recordings use mode `0600` and refuse symbolic links; they remain
  sensitive files and are not automatically deleted or excluded from Git.
- Diagnostics contain counters and metadata, not PCM payloads.
- Selecting a loopback device as another application's microphone makes
  injected audio available to that application; this is an explicit user
  routing decision.
- Source names may reveal which applications are running; treat diagnostic
  output as private local data.
