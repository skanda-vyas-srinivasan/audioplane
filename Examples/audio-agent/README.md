# AudioPlane realtime agent

This terminal reference application is installed as `audioplane agent` and
consumes only public AudioPlane Python APIs. It can send one live application
or microphone stream to OpenAI Realtime or Gemini Live, or exercise the same
source-aware flow entirely offline with a mock provider and recorded audio.
`audio_agent.py` remains a thin compatibility wrapper around the packaged
implementation.

From the repository root, install the SDK in a virtual environment:

Use [getting started](../../docs/getting-started.md) for native Runtime setup
and permission checks. For reviewing a full clip after playback instead of
live conversation, use [capture-and-review](../capture-and-review.py).

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install -e ./SDKs/python
```

Start `sonexis-runtime`, then run the credential-free path:

```sh
audioplane agent --provider mock
```

Choose a source by number. While capturing, enter `s` to switch sources or `q` to stop. The application prints stream/drop/latency statistics, watches for source removal and Runtime shutdown, and cleans up its capture on exit. `--output capture.wav` writes PCM16 audio for inspection.
The mock provider emits its deterministic response after five seconds of input
audio, so a shorter replay or capture intentionally produces no response.

Provider modes are optional and keep credentials in the environment:

Provider extras require Python 3.10 or newer; the offline mock and core SDK
remain compatible with Python 3.9. Create and activate a 3.10+ environment (for
example, `python3.10 -m venv .venv-ai`) before the provider install commands.

```sh
python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[openai]'
export OPENAI_API_KEY='...'
audioplane agent --provider openai --source Spotify

python -m pip install -e 'SDKs/python[gemini]'
export GEMINI_API_KEY='...'
audioplane agent \
  --provider gemini --gemini-model gemini-3.8-live --source 'Google Chrome' \
  --response-output default --debug
```

Gemini mode keeps Gemini's automatic VAD enabled and adds local end detection.
The packaged agent defaults to WebRTC speech detection: 100 ms of confirmed
speech, 100 ms onset-gap tolerance and 1,200 ms of non-speech sends one
`audio_stream_end`; further silence does not repeatedly finalize. The direct
sink retains energy detection unless a classifier is supplied.
`--debug` reports local activity edges, stream-end sends,
Gemini response starts/turn completion, and raw returned-audio byte counts.
Readable output transcription is printed normally. Tune application audio with:

```sh
audioplane agent \
  --provider gemini --gemini-model gemini-3.8-live --source 'Google Chrome' --debug \
  --gemini-vad energy \
  --gemini-start-threshold 0.015 \
  --gemini-end-threshold 0.008 \
  --gemini-min-activity-ms 250 \
  --gemini-silence-ms 1200
```

The start/end thresholds are normalized PCM RMS values. Raise them when steady
background audio opens turns; lower them when quiet speech is missed. Keep the
end threshold below the start threshold. A custom `VoiceActivityDetector` can
be supplied to `GeminiLiveSink` when energy thresholds are insufficient.

The CLI retains `gemini-3.1-flash-live-preview` as a compatibility default;
these commands explicitly select `gemini-3.8-live`. Gemini server VAD owns response boundaries; local
finalization does not guarantee one response per segment. Select another model explicitly
with `--gemini-model MODEL` or `GEMINI_LIVE_MODEL`. Models with proactive audio
may intentionally stay silent for passive commentary even after a valid turn.

The live reference path keeps capture reading independently of provider sends
through a bounded 32-packet, drop-oldest queue. If Gemini stalls, current audio
replaces stale audio and the next delivered frame carries a discontinuity plus
the exact dropped-frame count. While a non-interruptible Gemini response is
active, new input is intentionally discarded so turns cannot accumulate tens
of seconds behind the response. `--gemini-barge-in` disables that suppression
and allows new activity to interrupt the active response. An interruption also
discards queued model speech and flushes Runtime's render buffer, so stale bot
audio does not continue playing after the barge-in. Stream diagnostics report
input shedding separately as `provider_dropped` and `provider_queue_hwm`.

`--response-output DESTINATION` routes returned provider PCM through AudioPlane
Runtime's bounded output plane. `--play-response` is shorthand for destination
`default`. This works for both Gemini and OpenAI and never imports a Python
playback library. Provider receive and output playback run independently: a
slow destination cannot freeze the model event stream, and a bounded queue
fails explicitly instead of growing without limit. Provider PCM is coalesced
into 50 ms output packets, paced to at most 150 ms ahead of realtime, and a
sub-millisecond final tail is silence-padded to Runtime's legal packet minimum.
This prevents bursty model delivery from overflowing Runtime's render queue.
Use `sonexisctl outputs` to select a fixed speaker/headphone or an installed
loopback device. Raw returned-audio byte diagnostics stay behind `--debug`.

Provider modes select their required AudioPlane format preset automatically. No
credential or raw captured PCM is logged or stored unless `--output` is
explicitly supplied. Provider text/transcription and source/session identifiers
are printed to the terminal and may contain sensitive context. Recordings are
created as private regular files (`0600`), and symbolic-link targets are
refused.

For deterministic offline development, replay a matching PCM16 WAV:

```sh
audioplane agent \
  --provider mock \
  --replay /path/to/pcm16-mono-16khz.wav \
  --realtime-replay \
  --non-interactive
```

Use `--help` for socket, raw PCM, sample-rate, and channel options. Live OpenAI/Gemini network behavior still depends on the installed provider SDK, valid credentials, model availability, and the provider's current service API.

To exercise live capture, a deterministic mock response, and Runtime-owned
speaker output without provider credentials, use headphones and run:

```sh
audioplane agent \
  --provider mock \
  --source "Google Chrome" \
  --response-output default \
  --non-interactive
```

For an authenticated stability run, add `--validate-live`. AudioPlane prints a
privacy-safe PASS/WARN line for each completed turn and a final summary without
retaining PCM, credentials, or transcript text. `--validation-json PATH`
writes the same metadata to a private (`0600`) regular file:

```sh
audioplane agent \
  --provider gemini \
  --gemini-model gemini-3.8-live \
  --source "Google Chrome" \
  --response-output coreaudio:com.audioplane.input.device \
  --gemini-barge-in \
  --validate-live \
  --validation-json /tmp/audioplane-live-validation.json \
  --debug
```

`--debug` can print provider transcription and is therefore not privacy-safe
for shared logs. Validation JSON never contains transcript or PCM content.

Graceful `q`, Ctrl+C and SIGTERM persist validation metadata even if provider or
output cleanup fails. Cleanup waits are bounded (provider close: 7 seconds,
trailing events: 1 second, player close: 8 seconds, output client: 5 seconds;
SDK capture/input cleanup has its own bounded waits). Setup/source-selection
waits are also cancellable. SIGKILL, power loss, or a forcibly killed shell
cannot guarantee a final report. The terminal can lose its final summary when
plain `tee` exits on Ctrl+C; use `tee -i` to keep it alive through agent cleanup.
The JSON report does not depend on stdout remaining open.

Local activity segments are timing candidates, not provider turn IDs. Server
VAD can answer before a local end; these responses have no finalized-input
latency. Multiple candidate segments are reported as ambiguous, and segments
may receive no response. A single candidate's interval measures time since
local finalization; it does not prove provider causality. Validation summaries
include `correlation` and candidate segment indices and never substitute zero
for unknown or negative timing.

Playback diagnostics in validation JSON are metadata only. They include provider
chunk intervals, estimated supply gaps (an SDK clock estimate, not acoustic
latency), pacing waits, longest write wait, coalescer timeout flushes, output
session count, interruption discards/flushes, and sampled Runtime underrun,
drop, route-change and buffer counters. A 250 ms control-plane poll keeps these
separate from capture/provider-input drops. Sampling failures are counted;
zero input drops or zero sampled underruns do not prove gap-free sound.
`output_start_ms` measures SDK write acceptance, not speaker onset.

Sub-50 ms chunks are released within the existing 50 ms coalescing window when
the producer stalls. Runtime starts a nonempty partial render buffer after the
existing target-buffer duration (plus up to one 50 ms metrics-timer tick), so
short responses and resumed tails do not wait indefinitely for another chunk.
Full buffers start immediately as before; queue sizes, 150 ms pacing lead and
60 ms default priming target are unchanged. Ordered flush remains intentional;
a blocked write is cancelled and its output closed before recreation.

Run the real HAL short-response/re-prime regression with an already installed
BlackHole device and an authorized signed Runtime:

```sh
AUDIOPLANE_TEST_LOOPBACK_RUNTIME="$PWD/.build/signed-dev/bin/sonexis-runtime" \
PYTHONPATH="$PWD/SDKs/python/src" python -m unittest discover \
  -s SDKs/python/tests -p test_agent_loopback.py -v
```

The fixture generates PCM in memory and does not save captured audio or alter
the default device. Authenticated listening remains necessary to diagnose
network/provider gaps and perceptual glitches.
